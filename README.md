# kirby newsletter-addon
this will add a newsletter functionality to kirby.

>I developed this because I did not want to rely on 'professional newsletter providers'. 
>Basically due to privacy reasons and protecting customers email adresses from being 'sold'.

(Warning: added a widget recently, which is Kirby 2.0.7-nightly build only)

## note
I am by no means a developer in PHP or web stuff.
I post the code and files I created since I have no idea on how to move on with this. I believe I won't even get along with bugs, and issue fixing. Count this as an initial online store for further development.

Perhaps you can grab the code and develop it to a decent newsletter addon for kirby :)

# stuff to be done 
#### (which I cant personally ;))
- make a better monitoring of sending emails
- add some kind of 'abort' funcitonality to the system process (shell_exec) 
- make a better kirby app and use kirbys full potential with plugin/controllers, etc.
